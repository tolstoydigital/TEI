 I received your letter and the two issues of the magazine. Both were intensely interesting to me; indeed, the oppression of a majority by the minority of a people and the corruption which flows from it, is a phenomenon which has always occupied my mind and at present is entirely occupying my attention. I will endeavour to convey to you what I think, both in a particular and a general way, about those causes from which those dreadful calamities have arisen and do arise, of which you write in your letter and which are also mentioned in the two numbers of the Hindoo magazine you sent me.
 </p>

 Thecauses, owing to which this astonishing spectacle arises, of the majority of the labouring classes submitting to a mere handful of idlers whom it permits to dispose not only of its labour but also of its very life, are always and everywhere the same; whether the oppressors and the oppressed belong to the same, or, as is the case in India and in other countries, where the dominant class belongs to an entirely different nation from those oppressed.
 </p>
   <p id="d612dc6c-f304-4598-8aac-b572b26e0dda" rend="left">
 It appears especially strange of India, for here we have a people of 200 millions of individuals, highly endowed with spiritual and physical powers, in absolute subjection to a small clique, composed of persons utterly alien in thought and aspiration and altogether inferior to those whom they enslave.
 </p>
   <p id="c0fdbd02-41f7-4368-b65a-cf573ba33974" rend="left">
 These causes, as one can easily see from your letter, from the articles in «Free Hindustan», from the highly interesting writings of the Hindoo Swami Vivekananda and others, are in accord with that which causes the distress of all the peoples of our time; in the absence of a rational religious teaching which, while elucidating the meaning of life to the people in an equal way, would also make clear the higher law, which should be a guide to conduct, and in the substitution for them of the more than dubious propositions of a false religion and pseudo science, and in the immoral conclusions called civilization derived from both.
 </p>
   <p id="fdd8922e-4eb3-4c3f-aa4d-057840e8992f" rend="left">
 One has already seen not only from your letter and from the articles in «Free Hindustan», but also from the entire Hindoo political literature of our times, that the majority of the leaders of public opinion among the native races of India, while no longer ascribing any significance to those religious teachings which were professed, and are professed by the Hindoo peoples, now find the sole possibility of deliverance from the oppression they endure, in embracing those anti-religious and subtly immoral forms of social order in which the English and other pseudo Christian nations live to-day. Nothing shows more clearly than this, the total absence of religious consciousness in the minds of the present day leaders of Hindoo peoples, than does this tendency to instil into the hearts of the natives the acceptance of the forms of life in operation amongst European nations. Meanwhile, in the absence of this true religious consciousness and the guidance
 <pb n="247" />
 ofconduct flowing from it, in the absence which is common in our times to all the nations of the East and the West, from Japan to England and America: lies the chief if not the sole cause of the enslavement of all the Indian peoples by the English.

 In order to make my thoughts clear I must go back a considerable time.
 </p>
   <p id="93f0a7b6-05be-43d0-8221-365863f79257" rend="left">
 We do not know, and cannot know (I boldly say — we need not) how mankind lived millions, or even tens of thousands of years ago; but in all those times of which we have any reliable knowledge, we find that Humanity has lived in separate tribes, clans, nations, in which the majority, submitting to the apparently inevitable, has permitted the coercive rule of one, or several persons of the minority. We know this beyond a doubt. Notwithstanding the external diversity of events and persons, such an organisation of human life has manifested itself in a similar way, in all the countries of whose previous history we know anything. And such an order of life, the further back you go, was always looked upon as the necessary basis for concordent social intercourse by both the rulers and the ruled.
 </p>
   <p id="245d6060-46b2-480c-a299-f70add2eb66f" rend="left">
 Thus it was everywhere. But in spite of such an external order of life having existed for centuries and continuing even until now, a long time ago — thousands of years before our time, in the midst of different nations and often from out of the very centre of this order of life resting on coercion, one and the same thought has been expressed, — that in every individual one spiritual source manifests itself, which is life itself, and that this Spiritual source tends to unification with everything which is homogeneous with it, and attains this unification by love. This thought in its
 <pb n="248" />
 various forms has been expressed with more or less completeness and lucidity at different times and in various places. It has been expressed in Brahminism, Judaism, Mazdeism (the teaching of Zoroaster), Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, in the writings of the Greek and Roman sages, and in Christianity and Mohammedanism. Already the fact that one and the same thought has been expressed in the midst of the most diverse nations and at different times and places, indicates that this thought was inherent in human nature and contained the truth in itself.
 </p>
   <p id="23563faa-fb9e-427b-ae53-6040f4c1474e" rend="left">
 But this truth appeared to those who considered that the only possible way of uniting people into societies, was violence on the part of one set to others to be in opposition to the existing order, and, moreover, at the time of its first appearance, it was expressed in such a vague fragmentary manner, that although the people embraced it as a theory, they were unable to accept it as an authoritative guidance for conduct. Besides, in regard to all the expressions of this truth as it was gradually proclaimed amongst people whose life was founded on violence, always occurred one and the same thing, vis. those who enjoyed the benefits derived from power finding that the recognition by the people of this truth undermined their position, consciously or unconsciously distorted this truth by every means in their power, attaching to it attributes and meanings totally foreign to it, and also opposed its dissemination by downright violence. Thus the truth which is so natural to humanity —
 <hi rend="italic">
 that human life should be guided by the spiritual principle which is the foundation of human life and manefests itself in love,
 </hi>
 — in order to enter man’s consciousness had to struggle not only with the incompleteness of its expression and the intentional and unintentional distortions of it, but also with deliberate violence which compels by means of punishments and persecutions the acceptance of that explanation of the religious law established by the authorities, which is opposed to this truth. Such a misrepresentation and obscuration of the new but as yet imperfectly explained truth, took place everywhere, in Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, in Mohammedanism and also in your Brahminism.

 My hand has sowed love everywhere, giving unto all that will receive. Blessings are offered unto all my children, but many times in their blindness they fail to see them. How few there are who gather the gifts which lie in profusion at their feet; how many there are who, in wilful waywardness, turn their eyes away from them and complain with a wail that they have not that which I have given them! Many of them defiantly repudiate not only my Gifts, but Me also, Me, the Source of all blessings and the Author of their Being.

 This has taken place everywhere. The fact that love is the highest moral feeling was accepted universally, but the truth itself was interwoven with many and varied falsehoods, which so distorted it, that nothing but mere words remained, out of this recognition of love as the highest moral feeling. The theory was advanced that this highest moral feeling is applicable only to the individual life, that it was good only for home use, — but in social life all forms of violence, prisons, executions, wars, involving acts diametrically opposed to the feeblest sensation of love, were regarded as indispensable for the protection of the majority against evil doers. Notwithstanding that common sense clearly indicates, that if one set of people can arrogate to themselves the right to
 <pb n="250" />
 decide as to which people are to be subjected to all kinds of coercion for the supposed welfare of the many, it naturally follows that those few individuals to whom violence is so applied could also come to the same conclusion with regard to the ruling caste which subjected them to violence: and although the great religious teachers, — Brahmin, Buddhist and especially Christian, — anticipating this perversion of the law of love, directed attention to the one inevitable condition of love: the enduring of affronts, injuries, all kinds of violence without resisting the evil by evil, — mankind continued to accept what was incompatible: the beneficence of love, and with it the resistance of evil by violence, which is and must be opposed to love. And such teachings, in spite of the palpable contradiction which is in them, have taken such a deep hold upon the people, that while believing in the beneficiency of love, people fail to question the lawfulness of an order of life founded on coercion, which includes the imposition not only of tortures but also of death, by some persons upon others.
 </p>
   <p id="51db9902-6c45-4870-9586-89b4b3c69822" rend="left">
 For a long time people lived in this obvious contradiction without noticing it. But the day came when this contradiction begen to stagger the more thoughtful people of different nations. And the ancient simple truth that it was natural for people to help and to love, instead of torturing and killing each other, began to dawn upon the minds of men and became every day clearer, while the acceptance of those false interpretations by which the deviations from it were justified, became less and less convincing.
 </p>
   <p id="e8877acd-44eb-4532-8ffb-111989cf5220" rend="left">
 In ancient times the chief justification of violence was the theory that so-called monarchs, tsars, sultans, rajahs, shahs, and other heads of states had peculiar and Divine rights. But the longer people lived, the faith in special rights of monarchs sanctioned by God, became weaker and weaker. This faith declined in eqaul degree and almost simultaneously in the Christian, in the Brahman, in the Buddhist and in the Confucian spheres, and it has recently become so feeble that it can no longer serve, as it did before, as a justification of acts openly opposed to common sense and to the true religious feeling. People saw more and more distinctly, and to-day the majority see quite clearly the absurdity and the immorality of the submission of one’s will to that of others like oneself, who require of them actions not only contrary to their material welfare but which are also a violation of their moral feelings. It is, therefore, perfectly natural that people who
 <pb n="251" />
 havelost faith in the supported by religion devinity of the authority of all manner of potentates, should endeavour to free themselves from it. But unfortunately during the domination of those monarchs, considered to be Divinely appointed beings, established themselves near the courts, an ever increasing number of persons, which under the guise of governing the people lived upon their labours. And this governing class took care that as soon as the old religious fraud about divine rule of monarchs should cease to be believed by people another and similar deception should take its place and continue in the same way as the old one to keep nations in slavery to a limited number of rulers.

 New vindications of the power of potentates have replaced the obsolete ones. These justifications are as groundless as those they superseded but they are still new; hence their inconsistency cannot at once be quite clear to the majority, and, besides, the people who make use of power propagate them and support them in such a skilful manner that these justifications appear to many as quite incontrovertible, even to those who suffer from what they justify. These new vindications are termed scientific.
 </p>
   <p id="8c3ba66d-b2e4-4475-9e0f-424ffbc6ece1" rend="left">
 «Scientific» is a word that has for the majority the same power as has the word «religious». As all that was

 for the simple reason that it was called

 implied [that it] should be always the truth, exactly in the same way all that is called
 <hi rend="italic">
 scientific
 </hi>
 for the simple reason that it is called
 <hi rend="italic">

 </hi>
 , is always regarded [as] undoubtedly true. Thus, in this case the outlived religious justification of violence which consisted in the recognition of the peculiarity and divinity of personages being in power and put in power by God («there is no power but from God») was replaced by the justification consisting in the first
 <pb n="252" />
 placeof the fact, that as amongst people, the coercion of some by others has always been, it is proved that such violence must continue indefinitely. In this, i. e. that mankind should not live according to reason and conscience, but in obedience to that which has for a long time been taking place amongst them, — in this is embodied what «Science» terms the «historical law». The second «scientific» justification is, that as amongst plants and animals a struggle or existence goes on which always culminates in the survival of the fittest, the same struggle should go on amongst men (notwithstanding that men are beings endowed with the attributes of reason and love, faculties which are absent from beings submitting to the law of struggle and selection). In this consists the second «scientific» justification of violence.
 </p>
   <p id="5f6b3a48-adb9-4112-8b79-6535432bcff9" rend="left">
 The third scientific justification of violence the most prominent, and unfortunately the most widespread, is in reality the oldest religious justification only a little altered which is the theory that the use of violence in social life against some, for the welfare of others is inevitable, and, however desirable love amongst people might be, coercion is indispensable. The difference between the justification of violence by pseudo science and that of pseudo religion is in the fact that to the question, «Why such and such people, and not others, have the right to decide as to whom violence may and must be used against», — science does not give the same reply as that which religion had formulated: that these decisions are just because they are pronounced by personages who possess a divine power, but that these decisions represent the will of the majority, which, under a constitutional form of government is supposed to express itself in all the decisions and actions of the

 Such are the scientific vindications of coercion. These vindications, although quite groundless, are so necessary to people occupying privileged positions that they as implicitly beliefe in them, and as confidently propagate them, as they formerly did the doctrine of the immaculate conception.

 Meantime the unhappy majority weighed down by toil, is so dazzled by the display which accompanies the propagation of these «scientific truths», that, under this new influence it accepts them as readily as it formerly accepted the pseudo religious justifications and continues to submit slavishly to new potentates who are just as cruel as the former one, but who have some what increased in number.

 Thus it has been, and still is, going on in the Christain world. One could hope that in the vast Brahmin, Buddhist, Confucian worlds this new scientific superstition would not have place, and that the Chinese, the Japanese, the Hindoos, having seen the falsity of religious impositions which justify violence, would proceed direct to the conception of the law of love inherent in humanity, which has been so clearly enunciated by the great teachers of the East. But it appears that the scientific superstition which replaced the religious one, is getting a firmer and firmer grip upon the Oriental nations. It has now a specially strong hold on the land of the extreme East, Japan, not only upon its leaders but on the majority of its people and is the precursor to the greatest calamities. It has taken hold of China with her 400 millions of inhabitants, and also of your India with her 200 millions, or at least the bulk of the people who look upon themselves, as you do, as the leaders of these peoples.

 A commercial company enslaved a nation comprising 200 millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he will fail to grasp what these words mean.

 To the humanity of our times, Eastern or Western, the same thing happens which takes place in regard to every individual when he is passing from one age to the other (a child becoming a youth, a youth a man) and loses that which has been hitherto his guide in life, and not having elucidated a new one appropriate to his age, lives without any guidance and invents various anxieties, cares, amusements, provocations, untoxications, to distract his attention from the misery and selfishness of his own life.

 himself as well as for everybody — do not require new explanations and justifications of old religious superstitions, as Vivekanandas, Baba Bharatis and others have formulated in your country, and in the Christian world; an infinite number of such new interpreters and expounders of what no one stands in need; nor the innumerable sciences about matters which not only are unnecessary but mostly harmful (in the spiritual realm there is nothing indifferent, but what is not useful is always harmful). The Hindoo, as well as the Englishman, the Frenchman, the German, the Russian, do not require constitutions, revolutions, any conferences, congresses, any new ingenious devices for submarine navigation, aerial navigation, powerful explosives, or all kinds of conveniences for the enjoyment of the rich ruling classes; not new schools, universities with instruction in innumerable sciences, not the augmentation of papers and books, and gramophones and cinematographs, not those childish and mostly corrupt stupidities which are called arts; but one thing only is needful: the knowledge of that simple lucid truth — that the law of human life is the law of love, which gives the highest happiness to every individual, as well as to all mankind. If people only free themselves in their consciousness from those mountains of nonsense which hide the truth from them; and that indubitable eternal truth inherent to mankind which is one and the same in all the great religions of the world, will inevitably enter the soul of every man. And as soon as this is acknowledged by the great majority, stupidity which now conceals it will disappear and with it will by itself disappear all the evils from which humanity now suffers.

Постараюсь высказать вам то, что я думаю об этом вообще и в частности по отношению к тем причинам, вследствие которых произошли и происходят те страшные бедствия, о которых вы говорите в вашем письме и говорится в присланных вами мне номерах индийского журнала.

    Причины, по которым происходит то удивительное явление, что большинство трудящегося народа подчиняется кучке праздных людей, распоряжающихся не только трудами, но и жизнью большинства, всегда и везде одни и те же, как там, где угнетаемые и угнетенные принадлежат к одному и тому же народу, так и там, где, как это происходит в Индии и в других странах, угнетатели принадлежат к иной, чем угнетенные, нации. В Индии это кажется особенно странным, тaк как здесь более чем 200-миллионный, высокоодаренный и духовными и телесными силами народ находится во власти совершенно чуждого ему небольшого кружка людей, стоящих в религиозно-нравственном отношении неизмеримо ниже тех людей, над которыми они властвуют. Причины эти, как это видно из вашего письма и из статей
    <pb n="260" />
 «FreeHindusthan», и из весьма интересных сочинении индусского писателя Свами Вивекананды и других, состоят в том же, в чем причины бедствий всех народов нашего времени: в отсутствии разумного религиозного учения, которое, одинаково уясняя людям смысл их существования, определяло бы и высший закон, долженствующий руководить их поступками, и в замене и того и другого теми, более чем сомнительными положениями, ложной религии и ложной науки и вытекающими из того и другого безнравственными выводами, называемыми цивилизацией.

 Как видно из вашего письма и из статей не только «Free Hindusthan», но и из всей политической индийской литературы нового времени, большинство руководителей общественного мнения вашего народа, не приписывая уже никакого значения религиозным учениям, которые исповедовались и исповедуются индийским народом, видят единственную возможность избавления этого народа от претерпеваемого им угнетения в приобщении его к тем антирелигиозным и глубоко безнравственным формам общественного устройства, в которых живут теперь английские и другие мнимо-христианские народы. Ничто очевиднее этого стремления внушить индусскому народу усвоение форм жизни европейских народов не показывает в теперешних руководителях индусского народа полного отсутствия религиозного сознания. А между тем в этом отсутствии религиозного сознания и вытекающего из него руководства поведения, — отсутствии, общем в наше время всем народам и запада и востока, от Японии до Англии и Америки, и заключается главная, если не единственная причина порабощения индусского народа англичанами.

    Но, несмотря на то, что такое устройство жизни в своих внешних формах продолжалось веками, продолжается и теперь, еще очень давно, за тысячи лет до нашего времени, среди держащегося на насилии устройства жизни, была высказываема в различные времена, среди различных народов одна и та же мысль о том, что в каждом отдельном человеке проявляется одно и то же духовное начало, дающее жизнь всему существующему, и что это-то духовное начало стремится к единению со всем однородным ему и достигает этого единения любовью. Мысль эта в разных формах и с большей или меньшей полнотой и ясностью выражалась в разные времена и в разных местах. Выражалась она и в браманизме, и в еврействе, и в маздеизме (учение Зороастра), и в буддизме, и в таосизме, и в конфуцианстве, и в писаниях греческих и римских мудрецов, и в христианстве, и в магометанстве. Уже то одно, что мысль эта, одна и та же, высказывалась среди самых различных народов и в различное время, показывает то, что мысль эта была свойственна человеческой природе и заключала в себе истину. Но истина эта, провозглашавшаяся среди людей, считавших возможным соединение людей в общества только посредством употребления насилия одних над другими, была так несогласна с существующим устройством и, кроме того, была выражаема первое время своего появления так отрывочно и неясно, что люди, хотя отвлеченно и признавали ее, не могли принять ее как обязательное руководство поведения. Кроме того, со всеми выражениями этой истины, по мере того, как она высказывалась среди основанного на насилии устройства жизни людей, происходило
    <pb n="262" />
    одно и то же, а именно то, что люди, пользовавшиеся выгодами власти, чувствуя то, что признание людьми этой истины разрушало их положение, отчасти сознательно, отчасти бессознательно, как могли, извращали истину, одевая ее самыми чуждыми ей прибавлениями, толкованиями и, кроме того, прямым насилием противодействовали ее распространению. Так что свойственная человеческой природе истина о том, что жизнь человеческая должна быть руководима тем духовным началом, которое составляет основу жизни человеческой и проявляется любовью, для того, чтобы войти в сознание людей, должна была, кроме своей неясности выражения, бороться еще с умышленными и неумышленными извращениями ее, а также и с прямым насилием, заставлявшим людей наказаниями и гонениями признавать установленное властью понимание религиозного закона, противное открытой истине. Такое извращение и затемнение новой, не доведенной еще до полной ясности истины происходило везде: и в конфуцианстве, и в таосизме, и в буддизме, и в христианстве, и в магометанстве, и в вашем браманизме.

     Моя рука рассеяла любовь повсюду, предлагая ее тем, кто хочет взять ее. Благо дано всем моим детям, но часто в своей слепоте они не видят его. Только немногие поднимают те дары, которые в изобилии лежат у их ног, но еще больше тех людей, которые в своем самодовольном легкомыслии отворачиваются от них и с плачем жалуются на то, что у них нет того, что я дал им.

    Так это происходило везде. Везде истина о том, что любовь есть высшее нравственное чувство, не отвергалась и не опровергалась, но везде так искусно соединялась с таким количеством самой разнообразной лжи, извращающей ее, что от признания любви высшим нравственным чувством ничего не оставалось, кроме слов. Внушалось то, что это высшее нравственное чувство применимо только для личной жизни, годно, так сказать, для домашнего обихода, для общественной же жизни признавалось необходимым для блага большинства людей употребление против злых людей всякого рода насилия, тюрем, казней, войн, поступков, прямо противоположных самому слабому чувству любви. Несмотря на то, что здравый смысл говорил то, что, если одни люди могут быть решителями того, каких людей надо подвергать всякого рода насилиям ради предполагаемого блага многих, то и эти некоторые люди могли решать то же самое по отношению тех, кто их подвергал насилию, несмотря и на то, что великие религиозные учители — и браминские, и буддийские, и в особенности христианские, предвидя это извращение закона любви, прямо указывали на неизбежное условие любви: перенесение обид, оскорблений, всякого рода насилий без противления злу злом, люди продолжали признавать несовместимое: благодетельность любви и, вместе с тем, противление злу насилием, прямо противоположное любви. И такие учения, несмотря на явное заключающееся в них противоречие, так укоренились, что люди, признавая благодетельность любви, признают вместе с тем и законность устройства жизни, основанного на насилии, включающем нанесение одними людьми другим не только истязаний, но и смерти.

    Люди долгое время жили в этом явном противоречии, не замечая его. Но пришло время, когда противоречие это всё чаще и чаще стало поражать мыслящих людей разных народов. И древняя простая истина о том, что людям свойственно помогать и
    <pb n="264" />
    любить, а не мучить и убивать друг друга, всё более и более стала выясняться, и всё менее и менее могли люди верить в те лжетолкования, которыми оправдывались отступления от нее.

   <p id="5925e5ba-a0e9-49e7-83ca-79ffcfbf1b68" rend="left">
 В старинные времена главным средством оправдания употребления насилия, противного любви, было признание особенных, сверхъестественных прав за так называемыми государями, царями, султанами, раджами, шахами и т. п. главами государств. Но чем дольше жили люди, тем всё больше и больше стала ослабевать вера в особенные, освященные богом права государей. Ослабевала эта вера одинаково и почти одновременно и в христианском, и в браминском, и в буддийском, и в конфуцианском мире, а в последнее время уже так ослабела, что не могла уже служить, как прежде, оправданием поступков, явно противных и здравому смыслу и истинному религиозному чувству. Люди всё яснее и яснее и уже теперь в большинстве вполне ясно видят бессмысленность и безнравственность подчинения своей воли воле таких же, как они, людей, требующих от них поступков, противных не только их выгоде, но и нравственному чувству. И потому, казалось бы, естественно людям, потеряв веру в поддерживаемую религией божественность власти всякого рода властителей, освободиться от подчинения ей. Но, к сожалению, выгодами властвования над народами пользовались не одни эти считавшиеся сверхъестественными существами государи, но везде вследствие существования этих мнимо-сверхъестественных существ образовалось в продолжение их царствования всё большее и большее количество людей, пристраивавшихся к властителям и, под видом управления народом, живших его трудами. И вот эти-то люди позаботились о том, чтобы по мере того, как ослабевал старый религиозный обман о сверхъестественном и самим богом определенном властвовании государей, вырастал такой новый обман, который мог бы, заменив старый, продолжать так же, как и старый, держать народы в рабстве немногих властителей.

 На место устарелых, отживших религиозных оправданий ЯВИЛИСЬ новые. Оправдания эти так же неосновательны, как и прежние, но они еще новы, так что несостоятельность их еще не сразу может быть сознана большинством, и, кроме того, люди, пользующиеся властью, так искусно распространяют и поддерживают их, что оправдания эти многим, даже тем, которые страдают от того, что они оправдывают, кажутся неопровержимыми. Новые оправдания эти называются научными. Под словом же «научное» разумеется то же самое, что разумелось под словом «религиозное», а именно то, что так же, как всё то, что называлось религией, уже по одному тому, что называлось религией, всегда было несомненно истинно, так точно и всё то, что называется наукой, уже по одному тому, что оно называется наукой, всегда несомненно истинно. Так в данном случае отжившее религиозное оправдание насилия, заключавшееся в признании особенности, сверхъестественности лиц, стоящих во власти и утверждаемых во власти богом («нет власти не от бога»), заменилось научным оправданием, заключающимся, во-первых, в том, что всегдашнее существование среди людей насилия одних людей над другими доказывает то, что такое насилие должно всегда существовать. В этом, то есть в том, что люди должны жить не согласно с разумом и с совестью, а с тем, что долгое время происходило между ними, — в этом состоит то, что «наукой» называется «историческим законом». Второе же «научное» оправдание насилия состоит в том, что так как среди растений и животных происходит борьба за существование, оканчивающаяся всегда переживанием наиболее приспособленных, то эта же самая борьба должна происходить
 <pb n="266" />
    и между людьми, существами, одаренными свойствами разума и любви, — свойствами, отсутствующими у существ, подчиняющихся закону борьбы и отбора. В этом другом «научное» оправдание насилия.
   </p>
   <p id="f0ce8911-5ade-495e-a7e2-721d60732037" rend="left">
 Третье же, самое главное и самое, к сожалению, распространенное научное оправдание насилия есть, в сущности, самое старое религиозное оправдание, только несколько видоизмененное, состоящее в том, что, так как в общественной жизни бывает неизбежно необходимо употребление насилия против некоторых для блага многих, то, как ни желательна любовь людей между собою, насилие все-таки необходимо. Отличие оправдания насилия лженаукой от оправдания лжерелигией состоит только в том, что на вопрос о том, почему те, а не другие люди имеют право определять, кто именно те люди, против которых может и должно быть употреблено насилие, наука отвечает уже не то, что отвечала религия: что определения эти справедливы потому, что делаются лицами, имеющими сверхъестественную власть, а то, что определения эти представляют волю народа, которая будто бы при избирательном образе правления выражается во всех решениях и поступках людей, в данную минуту находящихся во власти.

    Таковы научные оправдания насилий. Оправдания эти не только неосновательны, но прямо нелепы, но они так нужны людям, занимающим привилегированное положение, что они слепо верят в них, как прежде верили в бессеменное зачатие, и так же уверенно распространяют эту веру.

    Несчастное же, задавленное трудом большинство так ослеплено той важностью, с которой передаются ему эти «научные истины», что, находясь под этим новым внушением, принимают, так же, как прежде принимали лжерелигиозные оправдания, все эти научные глупости за священную истину и продолжают рабски подчиняться своим новым, столь же жестоким, только несколько увеличившимся по численности властителям.

    С человечеством нашего времени, одинаково с восточным, как и с западным, совершается то же, что совершается с каждым отдельным человеком, когда он, переходя от одного возраста в другой (ребенок в юношу, юноша в мужа), теряет прежнее руководство в жизни и, не уяснив себе еще нового, свойственного его возрасту, живет без всякого руководства и придумывает, какие может, суеты, заботы, развлечения, раздражения, одурманивания, которые бы скрыли от него бедственность и бессмысленность его жизни.

Для того, чтобы люди могли воспринять истину уже не так смутно, как она представлялась им в период их детства, и не так односторонне и превратно, как она истолковывалась для них религиозными и научными учителями, а так, чтобы она стала высшим законом жизни людей, для этого нужно полное освобождение этой истины от всех, всех тех суеверий, как лжерелигиозных, так и лженаучных, которые теперь скрывают ее, освобождение не частичное, робкое, считающееся с освященным древностью преданием, с привычками народа, такое, какое в области религиозной сделано у вас Гуру Нанака, основателем религии сейков, а в христианстве Лютером и такими же реформаторами в других религиях, а полное освобождение религиозной истины от всех, как древних религиозных, так и новых научных, суеверий.

    Только освободи себя люди от верования в разных ормуздов, брам, саваофов, в воплощения их в кришнах и христах, от верований в рай и ад, ангелов и демонов, от перевоплощений и воскресений, от вмешательства бога во внешнюю земную жизнь; освободи себя, главное, от признания непогрешимости разных вед, библий, евангелий, трипитак, коранов и т. п.; освободи себя люди точно так же и от слепого верования в разные научные учения о бесконечно малых атомах, молекулах, о разных бесконечно великих и бесконечно удаленных мирах,

    их движениях и происхождении их, силах, от слепой веры в несомненность разных научных мнимых законов, которым будто бы подчинено человечество, — законов исторических, экономических, законов борьбы и переживания и т. п.; освободи себя только люди от этого страшного нагромождения праздных упражнений низших способностей ума и памяти, называемых науками, от всех этих бесчисленных отделов разных историй, антропологий, гомилетик, бактериологий, юриспруденций, космографий, стратегий, им же имя легион, — только освободись люди от этого губительного, одуряющего их балласта, и тот простой, ясный, доступный всем и разрешающий все вопросы и недоумения закон любви, который так свойственен человечеству, станет сам собой ясным и обязательным.

 Да, в наше время людям для избавления себя от наносимых ими самим себе, дошедших до высшей степени бедствий: индусу ли, ищущему своего освобождения от английского порабощения, или какому бы то ни было человеку в борьбе его с насильниками, будут ли эти насильники люди своего или чужого народа, в борьбе или негра с северо-американцами, или персиянина, русского, турка со своим персидским, русским, турецким правительством, как и вообще для каждого человека, ищущего наибольшего блага как для себя, так и для всех людей, нужны не новые объяснения и оправдания старых религиозных суеверий,
 <pb n="272" />
 какэто делали у вас Вивекананды, Баба-Барати и другие, и у нас, в христианстве, бесчисленное количество таких же новых толкователей и разъяснителей того, что никому ни на что не нужно; и не бесчисленные науки о предметах не только никому не нужных, но большею частью вредных (в духовной области не бывает безразличного, а то, что не полезно, всегда вредно). Нужны как индусу, так и англичанину, и французу, и немцу, и русскому не конституции, не революции, не какие-либо конференции, не конгрессы, не новые хитрые изобретения подводного плавания, воздушного летания, могущественных взрывов или различного рода удобств для удовольствия богатых, властвующих классов, не новые училища, университеты с преподаванием бесчисленных наук, не увеличение газет и книг, и граммофонов, и кинематографов, не те ребяческие, большею частью развратные глупости, которые называются искусствами, а нужно только одно: знание той простой, ясной, укладывающейся в душе каждого человека, не одуренного религиозными и научными суевериями, истины о том, что закон жизни человеческой есть закон любви, дающий высшее благо как отдельному человеку, так и всему человечеству. Только освободись люди в сознании своем от тех гор чепухи, которые скрывают теперь от них истину, и та, несомненно вечная, всегда свойственная всем людям истина, которая одна и та же во всех великих религиях мира, сама собой выделится из всей той лжерелигиозной чепухи, которая теперь скрывает ее. А выделится эта истина так, что войдет в сознание людей, и сама собой исчезнет вся та чепуха, которая скрывает ее, и вместе с ней и то зло, от которого теперь страдает человечество.
