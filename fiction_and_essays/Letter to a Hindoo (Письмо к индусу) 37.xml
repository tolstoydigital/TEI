 I received your letter and the two issues of the magazine. Both were intensely interesting to me; indeed, the oppression of a majority by the minority of a people and the corruption which flows from it, is a phenomenon which has always occupied my mind and at present is entirely occupying my attention. I will endeavour to convey to you what I think, both in a particular and a general way, about those causes from which those dreadful calamities have arisen and do arise, of which you write in your letter and which are also mentioned in the two numbers of the Hindoo magazine you sent me.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
    <pb n="246" />
 Thecauses, owing to which this astonishing spectacle arises, of the majority of the labouring classes submitting to a mere handful of idlers whom it permits to dispose not only of its labour but also of its very life, are always and everywhere the same; whether the oppressors and the oppressed belong to the same, or, as is the case in India and in other countries, where the dominant class belongs to an entirely different nation from those oppressed.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 It appears especially strange of India, for here we have a people of 200 millions of individuals, highly endowed with spiritual and physical powers, in absolute subjection to a small clique, composed of persons utterly alien in thought and aspiration and altogether inferior to those whom they enslave.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 These causes, as one can easily see from your letter, from the articles in «Free Hindustan», from the highly interesting writings of the Hindoo Swami Vivekananda and others, are in accord with that which causes the distress of all the peoples of our time; in the absence of a rational religious teaching which, while elucidating the meaning of life to the people in an equal way, would also make clear the higher law, which should be a guide to conduct, and in the substitution for them of the more than dubious propositions of a false religion and pseudo science, and in the immoral conclusions called civilization derived from both.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 One has already seen not only from your letter and from the articles in «Free Hindustan», but also from the entire Hindoo political literature of our times, that the majority of the leaders of public opinion among the native races of India, while no longer ascribing any significance to those religious teachings which were professed, and are professed by the Hindoo peoples, now find the sole possibility of deliverance from the oppression they endure, in embracing those anti-religious and subtly immoral forms of social order in which the English and other pseudo Christian nations live to-day. Nothing shows more clearly than this, the total absence of religious consciousness in the minds of the present day leaders of Hindoo peoples, than does this tendency to instil into the hearts of the natives the acceptance of the forms of life in operation amongst European nations. Meanwhile, in the absence of this true religious consciousness and the guidance
 <pb n="247" />
 ofconduct flowing from it, in the absence which is common in our times to all the nations of the East and the West, from Japan to England and America: lies the chief if not the sole cause of the enslavement of all the Indian peoples by the English.

 In order to make my thoughts clear I must go back a considerable time.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 We do not know, and cannot know (I boldly say — we need not) how mankind lived millions, or even tens of thousands of years ago; but in all those times of which we have any reliable knowledge, we find that Humanity has lived in separate tribes, clans, nations, in which the majority, submitting to the apparently inevitable, has permitted the coercive rule of one, or several persons of the minority. We know this beyond a doubt. Notwithstanding the external diversity of events and persons, such an organisation of human life has manifested itself in a similar way, in all the countries of whose previous history we know anything. And such an order of life, the further back you go, was always looked upon as the necessary basis for concordent social intercourse by both the rulers and the ruled.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 Thus it was everywhere. But in spite of such an external order of life having existed for centuries and continuing even until now, a long time ago — thousands of years before our time, in the midst of different nations and often from out of the very centre of this order of life resting on coercion, one and the same thought has been expressed, — that in every individual one spiritual source manifests itself, which is life itself, and that this Spiritual source tends to unification with everything which is homogeneous with it, and attains this unification by love. This thought in its
 <pb n="248" />
 various forms has been expressed with more or less completeness and lucidity at different times and in various places. It has been expressed in Brahminism, Judaism, Mazdeism (the teaching of Zoroaster), Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, in the writings of the Greek and Roman sages, and in Christianity and Mohammedanism. Already the fact that one and the same thought has been expressed in the midst of the most diverse nations and at different times and places, indicates that this thought was inherent in human nature and contained the truth in itself.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 But this truth appeared to those who considered that the only possible way of uniting people into societies, was violence on the part of one set to others to be in opposition to the existing order, and, moreover, at the time of its first appearance, it was expressed in such a vague fragmentary manner, that although the people embraced it as a theory, they were unable to accept it as an authoritative guidance for conduct. Besides, in regard to all the expressions of this truth as it was gradually proclaimed amongst people whose life was founded on violence, always occurred one and the same thing, vis. those who enjoyed the benefits derived from power finding that the recognition by the people of this truth undermined their position, consciously or unconsciously distorted this truth by every means in their power, attaching to it attributes and meanings totally foreign to it, and also opposed its dissemination by downright violence. Thus the truth which is so natural to humanity —
 <hi rend="italic">
 that human life should be guided by the spiritual principle which is the foundation of human life and manefests itself in love,
 </hi>
 — in order to enter man’s consciousness had to struggle not only with the incompleteness of its expression and the intentional and unintentional distortions of it, but also with deliberate violence which compels by means of punishments and persecutions the acceptance of that explanation of the religious law established by the authorities, which is opposed to this truth. Such a misrepresentation and obscuration of the new but as yet imperfectly explained truth, took place everywhere, in Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, in Mohammedanism and also in your Brahminism.

 My hand has sowed love everywhere, giving unto all that will receive. Blessings are offered unto all my children, but many times in their blindness they fail to see them. How few there are who gather the gifts which lie in profusion at their feet; how many there are who, in wilful waywardness, turn their eyes away from them and complain with a wail that they have not that which I have given them! Many of them defiantly repudiate not only my Gifts, but Me also, Me, the Source of all blessings and the Author of their Being.

 This has taken place everywhere. The fact that love is the highest moral feeling was accepted universally, but the truth itself was interwoven with many and varied falsehoods, which so distorted it, that nothing but mere words remained, out of this recognition of love as the highest moral feeling. The theory was advanced that this highest moral feeling is applicable only to the individual life, that it was good only for home use, — but in social life all forms of violence, prisons, executions, wars, involving acts diametrically opposed to the feeblest sensation of love, were regarded as indispensable for the protection of the majority against evil doers. Notwithstanding that common sense clearly indicates, that if one set of people can arrogate to themselves the right to
 <pb n="250" />
 decide as to which people are to be subjected to all kinds of coercion for the supposed welfare of the many, it naturally follows that those few individuals to whom violence is so applied could also come to the same conclusion with regard to the ruling caste which subjected them to violence: and although the great religious teachers, — Brahmin, Buddhist and especially Christian, — anticipating this perversion of the law of love, directed attention to the one inevitable condition of love: the enduring of affronts, injuries, all kinds of violence without resisting the evil by evil, — mankind continued to accept what was incompatible: the beneficence of love, and with it the resistance of evil by violence, which is and must be opposed to love. And such teachings, in spite of the palpable contradiction which is in them, have taken such a deep hold upon the people, that while believing in the beneficiency of love, people fail to question the lawfulness of an order of life founded on coercion, which includes the imposition not only of tortures but also of death, by some persons upon others.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 For a long time people lived in this obvious contradiction without noticing it. But the day came when this contradiction begen to stagger the more thoughtful people of different nations. And the ancient simple truth that it was natural for people to help and to love, instead of torturing and killing each other, began to dawn upon the minds of men and became every day clearer, while the acceptance of those false interpretations by which the deviations from it were justified, became less and less convincing.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 In ancient times the chief justification of violence was the theory that so-called monarchs, tsars, sultans, rajahs, shahs, and other heads of states had peculiar and Divine rights. But the longer people lived, the faith in special rights of monarchs sanctioned by God, became weaker and weaker. This faith declined in eqaul degree and almost simultaneously in the Christian, in the Brahman, in the Buddhist and in the Confucian spheres, and it has recently become so feeble that it can no longer serve, as it did before, as a justification of acts openly opposed to common sense and to the true religious feeling. People saw more and more distinctly, and to-day the majority see quite clearly the absurdity and the immorality of the submission of one’s will to that of others like oneself, who require of them actions not only contrary to their material welfare but which are also a violation of their moral feelings. It is, therefore, perfectly natural that people who
 <pb n="251" />
 havelost faith in the supported by religion devinity of the authority of all manner of potentates, should endeavour to free themselves from it. But unfortunately during the domination of those monarchs, considered to be Divinely appointed beings, established themselves near the courts, an ever increasing number of persons, which under the guise of governing the people lived upon their labours. And this governing class took care that as soon as the old religious fraud about divine rule of monarchs should cease to be believed by people another and similar deception should take its place and continue in the same way as the old one to keep nations in slavery to a limited number of rulers.

 New vindications of the power of potentates have replaced the obsolete ones. These justifications are as groundless as those they superseded but they are still new; hence their inconsistency cannot at once be quite clear to the majority, and, besides, the people who make use of power propagate them and support them in such a skilful manner that these justifications appear to many as quite incontrovertible, even to those who suffer from what they justify. These new vindications are termed scientific.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 «Scientific» is a word that has for the majority the same power as has the word «religious». As all that was
 <hi rend="italic">
 called relegious
 </hi>
 for the simple reason that it was called
 <hi rend="italic">
 religious
 </hi>
 implied [that it] should be always the truth, exactly in the same way all that is called
 <hi rend="italic">
 scientific
 </hi>
 for the simple reason that it is called
 <hi rend="italic">
 Science
 </hi>
 , is always regarded [as] undoubtedly true. Thus, in this case the outlived religious justification of violence which consisted in the recognition of the peculiarity and divinity of personages being in power and put in power by God («there is no power but from God») was replaced by the justification consisting in the first
 <pb n="252" />
 placeof the fact, that as amongst people, the coercion of some by others has always been, it is proved that such violence must continue indefinitely. In this, i. e. that mankind should not live according to reason and conscience, but in obedience to that which has for a long time been taking place amongst them, — in this is embodied what «Science» terms the «historical law». The second «scientific» justification is, that as amongst plants and animals a struggle or existence goes on which always culminates in the survival of the fittest, the same struggle should go on amongst men (notwithstanding that men are beings endowed with the attributes of reason and love, faculties which are absent from beings submitting to the law of struggle and selection). In this consists the second «scientific» justification of violence.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 The third scientific justification of violence the most prominent, and unfortunately the most widespread, is in reality the oldest religious justification only a little altered which is the theory that the use of violence in social life against some, for the welfare of others is inevitable, and, however desirable love amongst people might be, coercion is indispensable. The difference between the justification of violence by pseudo science and that of pseudo religion is in the fact that to the question, «Why such and such people, and not others, have the right to decide as to whom violence may and must be used against», — science does not give the same reply as that which religion had formulated: that these decisions are just because they are pronounced by personages who possess a divine power, but that these decisions represent the will of the majority, which, under a constitutional form of government is supposed to express itself in all the decisions and actions of the
 <hi rend="italic">
     party
    </hi>
 who at any given time is in power.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 Such are the scientific vindications of coercion. These vindications, although quite groundless, are so necessary to people occupying privileged positions that they as implicitly beliefe in them, and as confidently propagate them, as they formerly did the doctrine of the immaculate conception.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 Meantime the unhappy majority weighed down by toil, is so dazzled by the display which accompanies the propagation of these «scientific truths», that, under this new influence it accepts them as readily as it formerly accepted the pseudo religious justifications and continues to submit slavishly to new potentates who are just as cruel as the former one, but who have some what increased in number.

 Thus it has been, and still is, going on in the Christain world. One could hope that in the vast Brahmin, Buddhist, Confucian worlds this new scientific superstition would not have place, and that the Chinese, the Japanese, the Hindoos, having seen the falsity of religious impositions which justify violence, would proceed direct to the conception of the law of love inherent in humanity, which has been so clearly enunciated by the great teachers of the East. But it appears that the scientific superstition which replaced the religious one, is getting a firmer and firmer grip upon the Oriental nations. It has now a specially strong hold on the land of the extreme East, Japan, not only upon its leaders but on the majority of its people and is the precursor to the greatest calamities. It has taken hold of China with her 400 millions of inhabitants, and also of your India with her 200 millions, or at least the bulk of the people who look upon themselves, as you do, as the leaders of these peoples.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 In your magazine you insert as the basis principle which should direct the activity of your people the following thought as an epigraph: «
 <hi rend="italic">
 Resistance to aggression is not simply justifiable but imperative; non resistance hurts both Altruism and Egoism

    ».
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
 You say that the English have enslaved and keep the Hindoos in subjection because the latter have not resisted sufficiently, and do not resist the violence by force.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 But it is just the contrary. If the English have enslaved the Hindoos, it is just because the Hindoos recognised and do recognise coercion as the main and fundamental principle of their
 <pb n="254" />
 social order: in the name of this principle they submitted to their little Radjas, in their name they struggled with each other, fought with Europeans, with the English, and at present are preparing to a struggle with them again.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 A commercial company enslaved a nation comprising 200 millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he will fail to grasp what these words mean. What does it mean that thirty thousand people not athletes, but rather weak and illooking have enslaved 200 millions of vigorous, clever, strong, freedom-loving people? Do not the figures make it clear that not the English, but the Hindoos, have enslaved themselves?
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 For the Hindoos to complain that the English have enslaved them, is equal to people who are addicted to drikn, complaining that vendors of wine, who have settled in their midst, have enslaved them. You tell them that they can abstain from drinking, but they answer that they are so accustomed to it that they cannot abstain, that they find it necessary to keep up their energy by wine. Is not that the case with all the people, with millions of people who submit to thousands and hundreds of individuals, either of their own nation or of foreign nations?
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 If the Hindoos have been enslaved by violence it is because they themselves have lived by violence, live by violence, and do not recognise the eternal law of love, inherent in humanity.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 «Pitiful and ignorant is the man who seeks what he has already got, but is unaware that he has it. Yes, pitiful and ignorant is the man who does not know the bliss of that love which surrounds him, which I gave him» (Krishna).
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 If man lives only in accord with the law of love which includes non resistance, which has been already revealed to him and is natural to his heart, and hence does not participate in any form of violence, not only hundreds will not enslave millions but even millions will be unable to enslave one individual. Do not resist evil, but also yourselves participate not in evil, in the violent deeds of the administration, of the law courts, the collection of taxes, and what is most important of the soldiers, and no one in the world will enslave you.

 Love is the only means of saving people from all disasters which he may undergo. In your case the only means of liberating your

 peoplefrom slavery lies in love. Love as the religious foundation of human life was proclaimed with striking force and lucidity in the midst of your people in remote antiquity. Love, without non-resistance is a contradiction in itself. And there, in the 20th century you, a member of one of the most religious of peoples, with a light heart and with confidence in your scientific enlightenment and hence in your undoubted righteousness — you deny this law, repeating — pardon me — that colossal error which they, the defenders of violence, the enemies of the truth, at first the servants of theology, then of science, your European teachers, have instilled into you.

 To the humanity of our times, Eastern or Western, the same thing happens which takes place in regard to every individual when he is passing from one age to the other (a child becoming a youth, a youth a man) and loses that which has been hitherto his guide in life, and not having elucidated a new one appropriate to his age, lives without any guidance and invents various anxieties, cares, amusements, provocations, untoxications, to distract his attention from the misery and selfishness of his own life. Such a condition may last a long time.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 But as during the transition of an individual from one age to another, the time must inevitably come when life can no longer continue in the old ruts as before, in senseless anxiety and irritation, and the man must understand that the previous guidance for life is no longer applicable to him, — it does not follow that he must necessarily live without any rational guidance whatever, but that he should formulate for himself a theory of life corresponding to his age, and having elucidated it, he should in his new age be guided by it.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 Similar crises must of necessity occur in the ever changing life of humanity. And I am of opinion that the time has arrived
 <pb n="256" />
 forsuch a transition of humanity from one age to another, and not in the sense that it has arrived now, vis. 1908, but that the inherent contradiction of human life; the consciousness of the beneficence of the law of love, and the system of life built upon the law of violence opposed to love in our time has reached that degree of intensity under which it can no longer go on, and must be met by a solution, and evidently not with a solution which favours the outlived law of violence, but in favour of the truth that the law of human life is the law of love, cherished by all humanity from the most remote antiquity.

   <p rend="left">
 The recognition of this truth in its full significance is possible for men, only when they free themselves completely from all religious, as well as scientific superstitions by means of which it has been for centuries hidden from mankind.

 In order to save a sinking ship it is necessary to throw overboard the ballast, which though it might have been indispensable at one time, would now cause destruction. It is exactly the same with religious and scientific superstitions which hide this salutary truth from men. In order that people could embrace the truth, not in such a vague way as it presented itself to them during their childhood, nor in such a onesided, unstable way as it was interpreted to them by religious and scientific teachers, but in such a manner that it should become the highest law of human life; to effect this, the complete liberation of this truth from all,

 those superstitions pseudo religious as well as pseudo scientific which now obscure it, is necessary, not a partial, timid liberation, such a one as in the religious sphere was effected by Guru-Nanaka, the founder of the religion of the Sakas, and in Christianity by Luther, or similar reformers in other religions, but a complete deliverance of the religious truth from all those ancient religious, as well as from the modern scientific superstitions.

The Hindoo, as well as the Englishman, the Frenchman, the German, the Russian, do not require constitutions, revolutions, any conferences, congresses, any new ingenious devices for submarine navigation, aerial navigation, powerful explosives, or all kinds of conveniences for the enjoyment of the rich ruling classes; not new schools, universities with instruction in innumerable sciences, not the augmentation of papers and books, and gramophones and cinematographs, not those childish and mostly corrupt stupidities which are called arts; but one thing only is needful: the knowledge of that simple lucid truth — that the law of human life is the law of love, which gives the highest happiness to every individual, as well as to all mankind. If people only free themselves in their consciousness from those mountains of nonsense which hide the truth from them; and that indubitable eternal truth inherent to mankind which is one and the same in all the great religions of the world, will inevitably enter the soul of every man. And as soon as this is acknowledged by the great majority, stupidity which now conceals it will disappear and with it will by itself disappear all the evils from which humanity now suffers.

    Получил ваше письмо и два номера журнала. И то и другое мне было в высшей степени интересно, так как угнетение и неизбежно вытекающее из этого развращение одних людей другими, малым числом большого числа, есть явление, всегда занимавшее и особенно живо занимающее меня последнее время. Постараюсь высказать вам то, что я думаю об этом вообще и в частности по отношению к тем причинам, вследствие которых произошли и происходят те страшные бедствия, о которых вы говорите в вашем письме и говорится в присланных вами мне номерах индийского журнала.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Причины, по которым происходит то удивительное явление, что большинство трудящегося народа подчиняется кучке праздных людей, распоряжающихся не только трудами, но и жизнью большинства, всегда и везде одни и те же, как там, где угнетаемые и угнетенные принадлежат к одному и тому же народу, так и там, где, как это происходит в Индии и в других странах, угнетатели принадлежат к иной, чем угнетенные, нации. В Индии это кажется особенно странным, тaк как здесь более чем 200-миллионный, высокоодаренный и духовными и телесными силами народ находится во власти совершенно чуждого ему небольшого кружка людей, стоящих в религиозно-нравственном отношении неизмеримо ниже тех людей, над которыми они властвуют. Причины эти, как это видно из вашего письма и из статей
    <pb n="260" />
 «FreeHindusthan», и из весьма интересных сочинении индусского писателя Свами Вивекананды и других, состоят в том же, в чем причины бедствий всех народов нашего времени: в отсутствии разумного религиозного учения, которое, одинаково уясняя людям смысл их существования, определяло бы и высший закон, долженствующий руководить их поступками, и в замене и того и другого теми, более чем сомнительными положениями, ложной религии и ложной науки и вытекающими из того и другого безнравственными выводами, называемыми цивилизацией.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
 Как видно из вашего письма и из статей не только «Free Hindusthan», но и из всей политической индийской литературы нового времени, большинство руководителей общественного мнения вашего народа, не приписывая уже никакого значения религиозным учениям, которые исповедовались и исповедуются индийским народом, видят единственную возможность избавления этого народа от претерпеваемого им угнетения в приобщении его к тем антирелигиозным и глубоко безнравственным формам общественного устройства, в которых живут теперь английские и другие мнимо-христианские народы. Ничто очевиднее этого стремления внушить индусскому народу усвоение форм жизни европейских народов не показывает в теперешних руководителях индусского народа полного отсутствия религиозного сознания. А между тем в этом отсутствии религиозного сознания и вытекающего из него руководства поведения, — отсутствии, общем в наше время всем народам и запада и востока, от Японии до Англии и Америки, и заключается главная, если не единственная причина порабощения индусского народа англичанами.

    Для того, чтобы уяснить мою мысль, должен начать немного издалека.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Как жило человечество за миллионы, хотя бы десятки тысяч лет тому назад, мы не знаем и не можем (смело скажу, и не нуждаемся)
    <pb n="261" />
    знать; но то, что человечество с тех пор, как мы что-нибудь знаем о нем, всегда жило отдельными соединениями семей, родов, народов, в которых большинство покорно и охотно, считая это неизбежно необходимым, подчинялось насилию одного или нескольких лиц, самого малого меньшинства, это мы верно знаем. Такое устройство жизни людей, несмотря на внешнее разнообразие событий и лиц, проявлялось одинаково во всех народах, о прежней жизни которых мы что-нибудь знаем. И такое устройство жизни, чем дальше назад, тем больше считалось как властвующими, так и подвластными необходимым условием возможности согласного сожития людей между собою.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Так это происходило везде.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Но, несмотря на то, что такое устройство жизни в своих внешних формах продолжалось веками, продолжается и теперь, еще очень давно, за тысячи лет до нашего времени, среди держащегося на насилии устройства жизни, была высказываема в различные времена, среди различных народов одна и та же мысль о том, что в каждом отдельном человеке проявляется одно и то же духовное начало, дающее жизнь всему существующему, и что это-то духовное начало стремится к единению со всем однородным ему и достигает этого единения любовью. Мысль эта в разных формах и с большей или меньшей полнотой и ясностью выражалась в разные времена и в разных местах. Выражалась она и в браманизме, и в еврействе, и в маздеизме (учение Зороастра), и в буддизме, и в таосизме, и в конфуцианстве, и в писаниях греческих и римских мудрецов, и в христианстве, и в магометанстве. Уже то одно, что мысль эта, одна и та же, высказывалась среди самых различных народов и в различное время, показывает то, что мысль эта была свойственна человеческой природе и заключала в себе истину. Но истина эта, провозглашавшаяся среди людей, считавших возможным соединение людей в общества только посредством употребления насилия одних над другими, была так несогласна с существующим устройством и, кроме того, была выражаема первое время своего появления так отрывочно и неясно, что люди, хотя отвлеченно и признавали ее, не могли принять ее как обязательное руководство поведения. Кроме того, со всеми выражениями этой истины, по мере того, как она высказывалась среди основанного на насилии устройства жизни людей, происходило
    <pb n="262" />
    одно и то же, а именно то, что люди, пользовавшиеся выгодами власти, чувствуя то, что признание людьми этой истины разрушало их положение, отчасти сознательно, отчасти бессознательно, как могли, извращали истину, одевая ее самыми чуждыми ей прибавлениями, толкованиями и, кроме того, прямым насилием противодействовали ее распространению. Так что свойственная человеческой природе истина о том, что жизнь человеческая должна быть руководима тем духовным началом, которое составляет основу жизни человеческой и проявляется любовью, для того, чтобы войти в сознание людей, должна была, кроме своей неясности выражения, бороться еще с умышленными и неумышленными извращениями ее, а также и с прямым насилием, заставлявшим людей наказаниями и гонениями признавать установленное властью понимание религиозного закона, противное открытой истине. Такое извращение и затемнение новой, не доведенной еще до полной ясности истины происходило везде: и в конфуцианстве, и в таосизме, и в буддизме, и в христианстве, и в магометанстве, и в вашем браманизме.

    Так это происходило везде. Везде истина о том, что любовь есть высшее нравственное чувство, не отвергалась и не опровергалась, но везде так искусно соединялась с таким количеством самой разнообразной лжи, извращающей ее, что от признания любви высшим нравственным чувством ничего не оставалось, кроме слов. Внушалось то, что это высшее нравственное чувство применимо только для личной жизни, годно, так сказать, для домашнего обихода, для общественной же жизни признавалось необходимым для блага большинства людей употребление против злых людей всякого рода насилия, тюрем, казней, войн, поступков, прямо противоположных самому слабому чувству любви. Несмотря на то, что здравый смысл говорил то, что, если одни люди могут быть решителями того, каких людей надо подвергать всякого рода насилиям ради предполагаемого блага многих, то и эти некоторые люди могли решать то же самое по отношению тех, кто их подвергал насилию, несмотря и на то, что великие религиозные учители — и браминские, и буддийские, и в особенности христианские, предвидя это извращение закона любви, прямо указывали на неизбежное условие любви: перенесение обид, оскорблений, всякого рода насилий без противления злу злом, люди продолжали признавать несовместимое: благодетельность любви и, вместе с тем, противление злу насилием, прямо противоположное любви. И такие учения, несмотря на явное заключающееся в них противоречие, так укоренились, что люди, признавая благодетельность любви, признают вместе с тем и законность устройства жизни, основанного на насилии, включающем нанесение одними людьми другим не только истязаний, но и смерти.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Люди долгое время жили в этом явном противоречии, не замечая его. Но пришло время, когда противоречие это всё чаще и чаще стало поражать мыслящих людей разных народов. И древняя простая истина о том, что людям свойственно помогать и
    <pb n="264" />
    любить, а не мучить и убивать друг друга, всё более и более стала выясняться, и всё менее и менее могли люди верить в те лжетолкования, которыми оправдывались отступления от нее.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
 В старинные времена главным средством оправдания употребления насилия, противного любви, было признание особенных, сверхъестественных прав за так называемыми государями, царями, султанами, раджами, шахами и т. п. главами государств. Но чем дольше жили люди, тем всё больше и больше стала ослабевать вера в особенные, освященные богом права государей. Ослабевала эта вера одинаково и почти одновременно и в христианском, и в браминском, и в буддийском, и в конфуцианском мире, а в последнее время уже так ослабела, что не могла уже служить, как прежде, оправданием поступков, явно противных и здравому смыслу и истинному религиозному чувству. Люди всё яснее и яснее и уже теперь в большинстве вполне ясно видят бессмысленность и безнравственность подчинения своей воли воле таких же, как они, людей, требующих от них поступков, противных не только их выгоде, но и нравственному чувству. И потому, казалось бы, естественно людям, потеряв веру в поддерживаемую религией божественность власти всякого рода властителей, освободиться от подчинения ей. Но, к сожалению, выгодами властвования над народами пользовались не одни эти считавшиеся сверхъестественными существами государи, но везде вследствие существования этих мнимо-сверхъестественных существ образовалось в продолжение их царствования всё большее и большее количество людей, пристраивавшихся к властителям и, под видом управления народом, живших его трудами. И вот эти-то люди позаботились о том, чтобы по мере того, как ослабевал старый религиозный обман о сверхъестественном и самим богом определенном властвовании государей, вырастал такой новый обман, который мог бы, заменив старый, продолжать так же, как и старый, держать народы в рабстве немногих властителей.

 На место устарелых, отживших религиозных оправданий ЯВИЛИСЬ новые. Оправдания эти так же неосновательны, как и прежние, но они еще новы, так что несостоятельность их еще не сразу может быть сознана большинством, и, кроме того, люди, пользующиеся властью, так искусно распространяют и поддерживают их, что оправдания эти многим, даже тем, которые страдают от того, что они оправдывают, кажутся неопровержимыми. Новые оправдания эти называются научными. Под словом же «научное» разумеется то же самое, что разумелось под словом «религиозное», а именно то, что так же, как всё то, что называлось религией, уже по одному тому, что называлось религией, всегда было несомненно истинно, так точно и всё то, что называется наукой, уже по одному тому, что оно называется наукой, всегда несомненно истинно. Так в данном случае отжившее религиозное оправдание насилия, заключавшееся в признании особенности, сверхъестественности лиц, стоящих во власти и утверждаемых во власти богом («нет власти не от бога»), заменилось научным оправданием, заключающимся, во-первых, в том, что всегдашнее существование среди людей насилия одних людей над другими доказывает то, что такое насилие должно всегда существовать. В этом, то есть в том, что люди должны жить не согласно с разумом и с совестью, а с тем, что долгое время происходило между ними, — в этом состоит то, что «наукой» называется «историческим законом». Второе же «научное» оправдание насилия состоит в том, что так как среди растений и животных происходит борьба за существование, оканчивающаяся всегда переживанием наиболее приспособленных, то эта же самая борьба должна происходить
 <pb n="266" />
    и между людьми, существами, одаренными свойствами разума и любви, — свойствами, отсутствующими у существ, подчиняющихся закону борьбы и отбора. В этом другом «научное» оправдание насилия.

 Третье же, самое главное и самое, к сожалению, распространенное научное оправдание насилия есть, в сущности, самое старое религиозное оправдание, только несколько видоизмененное, состоящее в том, что, так как в общественной жизни бывает неизбежно необходимо употребление насилия против некоторых для блага многих, то, как ни желательна любовь людей между собою, насилие все-таки необходимо. Отличие оправдания насилия лженаукой от оправдания лжерелигией состоит только в том, что на вопрос о том, почему те, а не другие люди имеют право определять, кто именно те люди, против которых может и должно быть употреблено насилие, наука отвечает уже не то, что отвечала религия: что определения эти справедливы потому, что делаются лицами, имеющими сверхъестественную власть, а то, что определения эти представляют волю народа, которая будто бы при избирательном образе правления выражается во всех решениях и поступках людей, в данную минуту находящихся во власти.
 </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Таковы научные оправдания насилий. Оправдания эти не только неосновательны, но прямо нелепы, но они так нужны людям, занимающим привилегированное положение, что они слепо верят в них, как прежде верили в бессеменное зачатие, и так же уверенно распространяют эту веру.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Несчастное же, задавленное трудом большинство так ослеплено той важностью, с которой передаются ему эти «научные истины», что, находясь под этим новым внушением, принимают, так же, как прежде принимали лжерелигиозные оправдания, все эти научные глупости за священную истину и продолжают рабски подчиняться своим новым, столь же жестоким, только несколько увеличившимся по численности властителям.

     Кто я? Я то, чего ты искал с тех пор, как твой детский взгляд с удивлением смотрел на мир, пределы которого скрывают от тебя истинную жизнь. Я то, о чем ты молил в своем сердце, чего ты требовал, как право своего рождения, хотя и не знал, что это такое. Я то, что лежало в твоем сердце веками, тысячелетиями. Иногда я лежало в тебе с печалью о том, что ты не узнаешь меня. Иногда я поднимало голову, открывало глаза и простирало руки, призывая тебя, то тихо, то громко требуя от тебя, чтобы ты возмутился против тех железных цепей земли, которые притягивали тебя к праху.

    Так это происходило и происходит в христианском мире. Можно было надеяться, что в огромном брамино-буддийском, конфуцианском мире новое научное суеверие это не будет иметь места, и китайцы, японцы, индусы, поняв ложь религиозных обманов, оправдывающих насилие, прямо перейдут к сознанию свойственного человечеству закона любви, так сильно провозглашенного великими учителями Востока, но оказывается, что научное суеверие, заменившее религиозное, захватило и захватывает всё больше и больше восточные народы. Оно захватило уже с особенной силой и страну крайнего востока, Японию, и, кажется, уже не одних руководителей, но и большинство этого народа, готовя ему величайшие бедствия; захватило и 400-миллионный Китай и вашу 200-миллионную Индию, или, по крайней мере, большинство людей, считающих себя, так же как и вы, руководителями этих народов.

 Вы в своем журнале, как основной принцип, долженствующий руководить деятельностью вашего народа, ставите эпиграфом такую мысль: Resistance to aggression is not simply justifiable, but emperative; not resistance hurst both Altruism and Egoism (Противодействие нападению не только справедливо, но и обязательно: непротивление вредит одинаково и альтруизму и эгоизму).

    Любовь есть единственное средство спасения людей от всех претерпеваемых ими бедствий. В данном случае единственное средство освобождения вашего народа от порабощения только в любви. Любовь, как религиозная основа жизни людей, с особенной силой и ясностью была еще в далекой древности провозглашена в вашем народе. Любовь при допущении противления злу насилием есть внутреннее противоречие, так что теряет
    <pb n="268" />
    всякий смысл и значение. И что же? В 20-м веке вы, член одного из самых религиозных народов, с легким сердцем и уверенностью в своем научном просвещении и потому несомненной правоте отрицаете этот закон, повторяя ту — простите меня — поразительную глупость, которую внушили вам защитники насилия, враги истины, сначала служители богословия, потом науки, ваши европейские учителя.

    Вы говорите, что англичане поработили и держат в порабощении индусов потому, что индусы недостаточно противились и противятся насилию силою.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Но ведь это совершенно наоборот. Если англичане поработили индусов, то только потому, что индусы признавали и признают главными, основными принципами своего общественного устройства насилие. Во имя этого принципа подчинялись своим царькам, во имя его боролись между собой, боролись с европейцами, с англичанами и теперь стараются бороться с ними.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Торговая компания поработила 200-миллионный народ. Скажите это человеку, свободному от суеверия, он не поймет, что значат эти слова. Что значит то, что 30 тысяч людей, не силачей, даже скорее слабых и дурных людей, поработили 200 миллионов живых, умных, сильных, любящих свободу людей? Разве не ясно по одним цифрам, что не англичане, а сами индусы поработили себя. Индусам жаловаться на то, что англичане поработили их, всё равно, что людям, предающимся пьянству, жаловаться на то, что поселившиеся среди них продавцы вина поработили их. Вы говорите им, что они могут не пить, но они отвечают вам, что они так привыкли, что не могут воздержаться, что им стало необходимо поддерживать свою энергию вином. Разве не то же самое со всеми людьми, с миллионами людей, покоряющихся тысячам, сотням людей своих или чужих народов.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Если индусы порабощены насилием, то только оттого, что они сами жили насилием, живут насилием и не признают вечного, свойственного человечеству закона любви.

    «Жалок и невежественен тот человек, который ищет того, что он имеет, но не знает, что имеет его. Да, жалок и невежественен человек, который не знает блага той любви, которая окружает его, которую я дал ему» (Кришна).
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Только живи человек согласно с свойственным его сердцу и открытым уже ему законом любви, включающей в себя непротивление,
    <pb n="269" />
    и потому естественно не участвуя в каком бы то ни было насилии, и не только сотни не поработят миллионы, но миллионы не поработят одного. Не противьтесь злу, но и сами не участвуйте во зле, в насилиях администрации, судов, сборов податей и, главное, войска, и никто в мире не поработит вас.

     О вы, сидящие в заключениях и страдающие о свободе и ищущие ее, ищите только любви. Любовь есть мир в самом себе, и мир, дающий полное удовлетворение. Я — тот ключ, который отпирает дверь в ту редко открываемую страну, в которой одной живет довольство.

    С человечеством нашего времени, одинаково с восточным, как и с западным, совершается то же, что совершается с каждым отдельным человеком, когда он, переходя от одного возраста в другой (ребенок в юношу, юноша в мужа), теряет прежнее руководство в жизни и, не уяснив себе еще нового, свойственного его возрасту, живет без всякого руководства и придумывает, какие может, суеты, заботы, развлечения, раздражения, одурманивания, которые бы скрыли от него бедственность и бессмысленность его жизни. Такое состояние может продолжаться долго.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    Но как при переходе одного человека от одного возраста к другому неизбежно должно наступить время, когда жизнь не может уже продолжаться попрежнему, в бессмысленной суете и раздражении, и человек должен понять, что если прежнее руководство жизни уже несвойственно ему, то это не значит то, что ему надо жить без всякого разумного руководства в жизни, а только то, что надо постараться уяснить себе то понимание жизни, которое свойственно его возрасту, и, уяснив его, руководствоваться им в своем новом возрасте. Точно такие же времена должны наступать и для движущегося и изменяющегося человечества.
   </p>
   <p rend="left">
    И я думаю, что время такого перехода человечества от одного возраста к другому наступило теперь, и теперь не в том смысле, что оно наступило именно в 1908 году, а в том, что то внутреннее противоречие жизни людей: сознания благодетельности закона любви и устройства жизни на противном закону любви насилии, вызвавшее бессмысленную, раздраженную, суетливую
    <pb n="270" />
    и страдальческую жизнь человечества, продолжавшееся столетия, в наше время дошло до того напряжения, при котором оно не может уже более продолжаться и неизбежно должно разрешиться, и разрешиться, очевидно, не в пользу отжившего свое время закона насилия, а в пользу с самых древних времен уже сознаваемой всем человечеством истины о том, что закон жизни людей есть закон любви.

    Признание же этой истины во всем ее значении возможно для людей только тогда, когда они вполне освободятся от всех, как религиозных, так и научных, суеверий и вытекающих из них лжетолкований, извращений и нагромождений, посредством которых столько веков она скрывалась от человечества.

    Для того, чтобы спасти тонущий корабль, надо выбросить из него тот балласт, который если и был, может быть, когда-нибудь нужен, теперь губит его. То же и с религиозными и научными суевериями, скрывающими от людей спасительную для них истину. Для того, чтобы люди могли воспринять истину уже не так смутно, как она представлялась им в период их детства, и не так односторонне и превратно, как она истолковывалась для них религиозными и научными учителями, а так, чтобы она стала высшим законом жизни людей, для этого нужно полное освобождение этой истины от всех, всех тех суеверий, как лжерелигиозных, так и лженаучных, которые теперь скрывают ее, освобождение не частичное, робкое, считающееся с освященным древностью преданием, с привычками народа, такое, какое в области религиозной сделано у вас Гуру Нанака, основателем религии сейков, а в христианстве Лютером и такими же реформаторами в других религиях, а полное освобождение религиозной истины от всех, как древних религиозных, так и новых научных, суеверий.

    их движениях и происхождении их, силах, от слепой веры в несомненность разных научных мнимых законов, которым будто бы подчинено человечество, — законов исторических, экономических, законов борьбы и переживания и т. п.; освободи себя только люди от этого страшного нагромождения праздных упражнений низших способностей ума и памяти, называемых науками, от всех этих бесчисленных отделов разных историй, антропологий, гомилетик, бактериологий, юриспруденций, космографий, стратегий, им же имя легион, — только освободись люди от этого губительного, одуряющего их балласта, и тот простой, ясный, доступный всем и разрешающий все вопросы и недоумения закон любви, который так свойственен человечеству, станет сам собой ясным и обязательным.

 Да, в наше время людям для избавления себя от наносимых ими самим себе, дошедших до высшей степени бедствий: индусу ли, ищущему своего освобождения от английского порабощения, или какому бы то ни было человеку в борьбе его с насильниками, будут ли эти насильники люди своего или чужого народа, в борьбе или негра с северо-американцами, или персиянина, русского, турка со своим персидским, русским, турецким правительством, как и вообще для каждого человека, ищущего наибольшего блага как для себя, так и для всех людей, нужны не новые объяснения и оправдания старых религиозных суеверий,

 какэто делали у вас Вивекананды, Баба-Барати и другие, и у нас, в христианстве, бесчисленное количество таких же новых толкователей и разъяснителей того, что никому ни на что не нужно; и не бесчисленные науки о предметах не только никому не нужных, но большею частью вредных (в духовной области не бывает безразличного, а то, что не полезно, всегда вредно). Нужны как индусу, так и англичанину, и французу, и немцу, и русскому не конституции, не революции, не какие-либо конференции, не конгрессы, не новые хитрые изобретения подводного плавания, воздушного летания, могущественных взрывов или различного рода удобств для удовольствия богатых, властвующих классов, не новые училища, университеты с преподаванием бесчисленных наук, не увеличение газет и книг, и граммофонов, и кинематографов, не те ребяческие, большею частью развратные глупости, которые называются искусствами, а нужно только одно: знание той простой, ясной, укладывающейся в душе каждого человека, не одуренного религиозными и научными суевериями, истины о том, что закон жизни человеческой есть закон любви, дающий высшее благо как отдельному человеку, так и всему человечеству. Только освободись люди в сознании своем от тех гор чепухи, которые скрывают теперь от них истину, и та, несомненно вечная, всегда свойственная всем людям истина, которая одна и та же во всех великих религиях мира, сама собой выделится из всей той лжерелигиозной чепухи, которая теперь скрывает ее. А выделится эта истина так, что войдет в сознание людей, и сама собой исчезнет вся та чепуха, которая скрывает ее, и вместе с ней и то зло, от которого теперь страдает человечество.
